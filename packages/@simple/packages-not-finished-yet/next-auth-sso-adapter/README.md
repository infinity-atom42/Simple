An adapter for Next apps that implements openId connect protocol for an SSO provider
This is usefull if you have a microservice or another app that manages your users (ex. keycloak, (also put other examples of SSOs))
If you need more than just one provider (ex. keycloak, .., .., etc.) than use something like NextAuth
If you are searching for a simple way to connect your Next app to an SSO, this might be the simplest implementation for this neash case
